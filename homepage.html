    <h1>Growth Mindset<strong></strong></h1>
        <p>Have you ever did something new? Did you fail at it once, twice or even three times?
         Did you continue despite those failures and along the way change some things up so that one day you will succeed? 
         If you answered yes to this you exemplify the personality attribute of a growth mindset. Growth Mindset is a very important
         attribute to exemplify because it enables us to challenge what we believed to be true and in return discover entirely different positive
         truths about ourselves.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Examples of growth mindset in popular culture include Michael Jordan who was cut from his freshman basketball team.
            He in turn became one of the greatest basketball players the world has ever seen. Oprah Winfrey being another example.
            She was demoted from her job as a news anchor because she was told she "wasn't fit for television" </p>
